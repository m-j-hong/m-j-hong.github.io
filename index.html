        design isn’t made. it’s discovered. it isn’t created. it’s remembered
        <br>
        i think design is one of those beautiful things that directly reminds us of the 
        truth of it all. it’s impossible to fully describe because it’s one step in our
        world of “separate” forms and one step in the boundless, indivisible love of the cosmos.
        <br>
        <br>
        good design is something that you know exactly what to do with before you even 
        see it; everything about its construction is already identical to the purpose 
        that it serves. it’s beautiful to look at, but not because it makes you think. 
        it allows you to stop thinking, to enter into doing directly from being. interacting 
        with it is a dance, where you respond to it and it responds to you seamlessly. there 
        is no delay, no lag of thought-computing between intent and action. design is 
        empathetic, it listens to you. the best design is something that you feel like already 
        completely understands you as a user. the most effective design comes from the closest,
        most sensitive and receptive listening.
        <br>
        <br>
        our job as designers is to get out of the way. we must become porous enough that 
        solutions arise through us. we are not creators, but conduits; we are thresholds through 
        which what already exists can come into form
        <br>
        <br>
        nature is the most perfect designer; natural selection IS design. not forcing something 
        into a space, but rather allowing the shaping and molding of form by the patterns, needs, 
        behaviors of the immediate environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        in order to allow good design to happen, you have to put yourself in a profoundly empathetic
        position. design is not something you think about. it shows up in how you feel, but deeper 
        than that, it is dictated by the patterns by which you live. design is not a thing, not an 
        object, but rather a doorway. a threshold between the manifested and the manifesting. bad 
        design is full of friction, resistance. it is insulation between what is physically 
        perceivable and what is coming into being. good design is smooth, fluid, elegant in all
        patterns of actions it responds to.
